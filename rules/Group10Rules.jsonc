            Some notes: An important term here is "meaningful". Our goal with this project is to find people who are not making meaningful contributions.
            The meaningful threshold below defines the number of lines of code that the commit must contain in order to be considered meaningful.
            All numbers below are placeholders/defaults. Remember that a manager should be able to edit these to their liking/needs.
            Finally, a 0 or "" value means that rule should be skipped.
